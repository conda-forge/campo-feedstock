  summary: Modelling framework for fields and agents
  description: |
    Campo is an environmental modelling framework for the construction of
    spatio-temporal models with support for field-based and agent-based
    phenomena. Campo provides the elementary building blocks for the
    construction and execution of field-agent models: operations accepting
    both fields and agents as arguments, and operations that are dedicated
    either to fields or to agents. Campo resembles and extends the map algebra
    approach to field-agent modelling and allows for the construction of static
    or dynamic models.
